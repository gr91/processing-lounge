Processing Lounge
=================

A [slowly growing] collection of Processing drafts that I use for my course at Academy of Fine Arts and ISIA Uni [both in Urbino, Italy].

Pretty useless for those who already know how to program in Processing.

Some recipes are my own work and some found on the net [the authors are always mentioned at the beginning].
