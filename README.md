Processing Lounge
=================

A [slowly growing] collection of Processing drafts that I use for my course at Academy of Fine Arts and ISIA Uni [both in Urbino, Italy].

Pretty useless for those who already know how to program in Processing.

Some recipes are my own work and some found on the net [the authors are always mentioned at the beginning].

### Welcome
This is a [slowly growing] collection of Processing recipes that I use for my lessons at [Academy of Fine Arts](http://www.accademiadiurbino.it), [ISIA](http://isiaurbino.net) and [IUAV](http://www.iuav.it/) universities.

It's a pretty useless sketchbook for those who already know how to program in Processing, but it could be useful for absolute beginners.

Some recipes are my own work and some found on the net: all the authors are always mentioned at the beginning.
