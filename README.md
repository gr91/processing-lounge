Processing Lounge
=================

This is a [slowly growing] collection of Processing recipes that I use for my lessons at [Academy of Fine Arts](http://www.accademiadiurbino.it), [ISIA](http://isiaurbino.net) and [IUAV](http://www.iuav.it/) universities.

It's a pretty useless sketchbook for those who already know how to program in Processing, but it could be useful for absolute beginners.

Some recipes are my own work and some found on the net: all the authors are always mentioned at the beginning.

Plese note that you can access to archives even browsing [this .io page] (http://davideriboli.github.io/processing-lounge/).
